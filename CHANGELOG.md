# 1.0.0 2016-8-09

Moved to github pages. 1.0 because it's stable. Development stopped since last release a year ago.

# 0.3.0 2015-27-09

This is a refactoring / bugfixing update with slight changes.

## Added

+ Entity form warnings

  The new entity form now warns you if the inputs aren't valid.

+ Add notes button

  You can now add notes with a button, not just as a submit.

+ Logo

  We now have an actual logo.

## Changed

+ Visuals

  Redid some visuals, like the active / dead indicators are now just a tiny bar on the left of the entity, instead of colouring the whole thing.

+ Redux

  We're now using redux architecture instead of keeping all state on the root component.

+ Better build

  Gulpfile has been enhanced a ton, better development experience.

## Fixed

+ Dragging

  Dragging-to-reorder should now work pretty well.

+ Scaling

  Reworked the mobile scaling, so now it's actually usable.

# 0.2.0 2015-30-05

This is a community-made update, implemented things from the reddit thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/37r1v2/hey_guys_im_a_dm_and_ive_needed_a_simple/).

## Added

+ Notes

  Added the ability to add notes to each entity.

## Changed

+ Healing/damaging

  Instead of having the health increment or decrement by one, you now add in the amount you want to heal or damage, and press the corresponding button.

+ Adding entities usability improvements

  Adding entities now works as a form, so you can choose next/previous on mobile, and on a computer you can just press enter to submit.

# 0.1.0 2015-29-05

First version.
